Requires the following github to create the content for the website:

The website_files directory contains:
- chalkItUp.ttf : a chalk font
- A bootstrap folder and jumbotron.css : css files mainly used for the top navbar
- an aladin lite folder : tweaked Aladin lite, mostly removing some unwanted clutter and surveys from the original code
- an images folder : contains a few general images used by the website such as the arrows
- website_IDxxx : an empty folder where your generated SOM-specific content should end up
- lofar_IDxxx.php : index page
- outliers_IDxxx.php : page for outliers
- about_IDxxx.php : page for acknowledgements
